# Discrete Unification Theory (DUT)

The **Discrete Unification Theory (DUT)** proposes a novel theoretical framework designed to address fundamental issues in physics. By integrating concepts from General Relativity and Quantum Mechanics into a dynamic non-commutative geometric structure, the theory aims to resolve long-standing inconsistencies and provide new insights into the nature of the universe.

## Overview

The DUT focuses on unifying existing physical frameworks while tackling cosmological challenges such as dark matter, dark energy, and the cosmological constant. The theory is built upon the principles of **Dynamic Non-Commutative Geometry (DNCG)**, redefining spacetime at quantum levels and offering solutions that extend beyond the limitations of traditional models.

### Objectives:
1.  **Theoretical Unification**:
    -   Develop a cohesive model that reconciles the mathematical structures of General Relativity and Quantum Mechanics.
2.  **Cosmological Understanding**:
    -   Provide dynamic scalar fields to describe dark matter and dark energy.
3.  **Fundamental Constants**:
    -   Propose mechanisms to stabilize the cosmological constant and resolve the quantum hierarchy problem.

## Key Innovations

1.  **Non-Commutative Spacetime**:
    -   Introduces uncertainty in the structure of spacetime by treating coordinates as non-commutative operators, leading to a more refined understanding of quantum phenomena.
2.  **Emergent Gravity**:
    -   Reframes gravitational effects as emergent properties derived from algebraic and geometric relationships rather than fundamental fields.
3.  **Experimental Predictions**:
    -   Offers testable hypotheses that can be evaluated through observational data and high-energy physics experiments.
4.  **Cosmological Insights**:
    -   Provides new frameworks to analyze and predict the behavior of dark matter, dark energy, and other cosmological phenomena.

Its implications extend to various domains, including particle physics, cosmology, and theoretical physics, offering a comprehensive approach to understanding the universe.

This repository serves as a platform to share the theoretical foundation of DUT, inviting constructive feedback, academic discussion, and collaborative exploration. Researchers and scholars are encouraged to engage with the material, provide commentary, and build upon the concepts introduced herein.

## Working with the LaTeX Source

The theoretical documents are written in LaTeX. This section provides details on the project structure and how to compile the source files to generate a PDF version of the theory.

### LaTeX Project Structure

The LaTeX source code and related files are organized as follows:

-   **`/` (Root Directory):** Contains the main published PDF versions of the theory (`DUT_ENGv2.0.pdf`, `TUD_SPv20.0.pdf`), this `README.md` file, the `.gitignore` file, and other general project files.
-   **`/main/`:** This directory contains all the LaTeX source files for the theory.
    -   `/main/main.tex`: This is the primary LaTeX file. You should compile this file to generate the document.
    -   `/main/figures/`: This subfolder holds all the images and figures used within the LaTeX document.
    -   `/main/bibliography/`: This subfolder contains the BibTeX file (e.g., `references.bib`) for managing citations and references.

### Author's Environment and Package Management

The author primarily uses **TeXworks** as the LaTeX editor. A significant reason for this choice is the convenience offered by the accompanying LaTeX distribution (often a full installation of TeX Live or MiKTeX). Such distributions typically install a comprehensive set of LaTeX packages from the outset. This approach minimizes interruptions for on-demand package installations during document preparation, ensuring a smoother workflow.

While this setup benefits the author, collaborators should ensure they have a reasonably complete LaTeX distribution or one capable of installing missing packages as needed.

### Compilation Instructions

To compile `main/main.tex` and generate the PDF document:

1.  **Prerequisites:**
    * Ensure you have a working LaTeX distribution installed on your system (e.g., [TeX Live](https://www.tug.org/texlive/), [MiKTeX](https://miktex.org/), or MacTeX for macOS users).

2.  **Recommended Compilation Methods:**

    * **Using TeXworks (Author's Preferred Method):**
        1.  Open the file `/main/main.tex` with TeXworks.
        2.  Use the "Typeset" (or "Composición") button. TeXworks is typically pre-configured to run the necessary sequence of commands (e.g., `pdfLaTeX`, `BibTeX`, then `pdfLaTeX` again) to fully compile the document, including references and cross-citations.

    * **Using `latexmk` (Recommended for Consistency and Collaboration):**
        1.  Open your terminal or command prompt.
        2.  Navigate to the `/main` directory within the project: `cd main`
        3.  Run the command:
            ```bash
            latexmk -pdf main.tex
            ```
        4.  `latexmk` will automatically handle the multiple compilation passes required for LaTeX, BibTeX, etc.

    * **Other LaTeX Editors:** Most dedicated LaTeX editors (like TeXstudio, VS Code with the LaTeX Workshop extension, etc.) provide a "Build" or "Compile" button that will also manage the compilation sequence.

3.  **Output:**
    * The compiled PDF (e.g., `main.pdf`) and all auxiliary files (`.aux`, `.log`, `.bbl`, etc.) will be generated inside the `/main` directory.

### Auxiliary Files

LaTeX generates several auxiliary files during compilation. These are temporary or local build files and are not essential for distribution. They are listed in the `.gitignore` file at the root of this repository and should not be committed to version control. Collaborators will generate their own auxiliary files upon compilation.
